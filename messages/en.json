I transferred from the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering at Suzuka National College of Technology, and I am currently studying both frontend and backend software development. I enjoy exploring new technologies and aim to create better products by honing my skills through hands-on experience.\n\nMy motto in programming is to pursue simplicity. I always strive to write clean and readable code, and I focus on providing user-friendly services.\n\nAt Suzuka College of Technology, I was involved in research on the digital transformation of a biodiesel fuel production plant.I worked on developing systems for quantifying the stirring state using image processing and building an operation system that does not require specialized knowledge. Through this project, I experienced the full workflow from system design to implementation and operation.\n\nAt the University of Tsukuba, I am a member of a student team called iGEM TSUKUBA, preparing for the international synthetic biology competition iGEM.Our research focuses on multi-objective optimization of proteins. Using protein language models, we aim to design high-performance protein sequences from a limited amount of experimental data. Through this research, I have developed a strong interest in bioinformatics.\n\nRecently, my hobbies include personal software development and watching anime.I enjoy building applications that solve everyday problems, and I especially like refining the visual design of the products I create."
